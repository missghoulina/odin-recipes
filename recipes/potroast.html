    <p><h2>Description:</h2></p>
    <p>This is an easy oven-baked pot roast with vegetables. The aroma will make you hungry while this delicious roast bakes.</p>
    <p><h2>Ingredients:</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds beef pot roast, fat trimmed and discarded</li>
        <li>3 potatoes, peeled and cut into 6 pieces</li>
        <li>1 large onion, cut into 8 pieces</li>
        <li>2 carrots, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 stalks celery, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>3½ cups water</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon browning sauce (such as Gravy Master®) (Optional)s</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h2>Steps:</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place roast in a large baking pan; arrange potatoes, onion, carrots, and celery around roast. Pour 3 cups water into baking pan. Season roast with salt, pepper, and garlic salt. Cover pan with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until roast is browned and cooked through, about 3 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the roast should read 145 degrees F (65 degrees C). Transfer roast to an oven-safe platter. Remove vegetables using a slotted spoon and arrange around roast.</li>
        <li>educe oven temperature to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Place platter with roast and vegetables in the oven to keep warm.</li>
        <li>Pour the remaining juices from the baking pan into a saucepan; bring to a boil. Stir 1/2 cup water and cornstarch together in a bowl until smooth; pour into boiling pan juices. Reduce heat to medium; cook, stirring constantly, until gravy is thick, about 5 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Stir in browning sauce.</li>
    </ol>
